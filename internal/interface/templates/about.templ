					About Me
				</h1>
				<p class="text-xl xl:text-2xl font-lexend text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-8 text-justify md:text-left">
					My name is <span class="text-orange-300 text-shadow-xs">Demetrius Papas</span>. I am a software developer with a passion for figuring things out and an intrinsic motivation for doing things right.
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl font-montserrat text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-4 text-justify md:text-left">
					I've studied software development at a university level, having completed ~200 ECTS of courses on Computer & Software Engineering at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytechnic_(Greece)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">Polytechnic School</a> of the <a href="https://www.uth.gr/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-300 hover:text-orange-400 font-bold text-shadow-xs">University of Thessaly</a>, Greece, gaining a solid foundation of formal knowledge.
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl font-montserrat text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-4 text-justify md:text-left">
					During my studies I interned at <a href="https://centaur.ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-300 font-bold hover:text-orange-400 text-shadow-xs">Centaur Analytics</a> where I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with the software development lifecycle in a professional setting. Under the guidance of a team of very talented people I undertook the development of an api consumer tool for internal use, with nodejs, express & MongoDB. Following test driven development practices was a formative experience for me at those early stages of my technical progression.
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl font-montserrat text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-4 text-justify md:text-left">
					I am particularly drawn to developing APIs, services, tools and applications but I actively pursue expanding my encyclopedic knowledge and staying up-to-date with how the field of software development is evolving throughout all of its facets outside my direct ecosystem too. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl font-montserrat text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-4 text-justify md:text-left">
					Pursuing my interests further, I studied back-end web development principles and learnt <span class="font-lexend text-shadow-xs text-sky-300">Go</span> on <a href="https://boot.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-orange-300 hover:text-purple-600/50 font-bold text-shadow-xs">boot.dev</a>, which is an exceptional platform that I would unreservedly recommend to anyone. There I completed several guided projects such as building a microblogging service and I've since been applying the skills that I acquired there to develop more complex web application projects with a focus on further familiarizing myself with industry standard libraries, software & services such as Apache Kafka, Prometheus and Grafana. I am proficient with essential development infrastructure: version control, containerization with docker/podman, CI/CD pipelines etc.
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl font-montserrat text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-4 text-justify md:text-left">
					Widening my horizons & dispelling the "fog-of-war", if you will, is a big part of my motivation. Similarly, I am wired to dig deep and really try to get to the bottom of stuff. I find joy in the learning, the mastering, and the productive process itself.
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl font-montserrat text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-4 text-justify md:text-left">
					I strive to be sensible and purposeful with my decisions. I have a preference for planning and figuring things out, trying to be proactive about the potential pitfalls of a project and technical debt in general, as opposed to being trigger-happy with an implementation and then iterating reactively. I don't criticize the latter approach though, I would arguably benefit from it if it would come to me more naturally a little more often. No tool is the right one for every job after all, and I am not a fan of dogma either. As a natural consequence of this I highly value collaboration and exposure to other people's perspectives that challenge my own thinking and processes.
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl font-montserrat text-chalkpapyrus text-outline-sm mb-12 text-justify md:text-left">
					I am excited to explore new opportunities where I can apply these perspectives professionally and continue growing as a developer. If you think my approach would complement your team, I'd be glad to connect and discuss potential collaborations.
